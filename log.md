**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Today's Progress**: Setup #100DaysofCode, freeCodeCamp Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** Made some minor adjustments to my freeCodeCamp Tribute Page after finishing it last night at the FCC NYC meetup. Spent the remaining time reading up on Git and setting up #100DaysofCode.

### Day 2: January 28, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Start jQuery freeCodeCamp course.

**Thoughts:** The jQuery course so far has been a bit of a refresh, but it's clear that I just need to spend some more time practicing how to write proper syntax, understanding the purpose of the invdividual components and their relationship to vanilla js.

Just finished the jQuery courses and I'm concerned I'm going through them too fast? FCC identified this as a 3hr course and I finished in just over 1.5hrs tops. 


### Day 3: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the FCC JS Course, Flexbox frogger.

**Thoughts:** Went back and reviewed the basic FCCjQuery course and started the FCC JS challenges (yay algorithms).
