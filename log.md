**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

**Today's Progress**: Setup #100DaysofCode, freeCodeCamp Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** Made some minor adjustments to my freeCodeCamp Tribute Page after finishing it last night at the FCC NYC meetup. Spent the remaining time reading up on Git and setting up #100DaysofCode.

### Day 2: January 28, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Start jQuery freeCodeCamp course.

**Thoughts:** The jQuery course so far has been a bit of a refresh, but it's clear that I just need to spend some more time practicing how to write proper syntax, understanding the purpose of the invdividual components and their relationship to vanilla js.

Just finished the jQuery courses and I'm concerned I'm going through them too fast? FCC identified this as a 3hr course and I finished in just over 1.5hrs tops. 


### Day 3: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the FCC JS Course, Flexbox frogger.

**Thoughts:** Went back and reviewed the basic FCCjQuery course and started the FCC JS challenges (yay algorithms). Discovered a fun new way to learn flexbox and really think I'm going to start implementing it into my projects (so simple in comparison to other positioning solutions).

### Day 4: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC JS Course, revisited D3js documentation.

**Thoughts:** Meant to post this last night, but was soo tired, I'm just posting it in from my desk at work on 31 Jan 2017. I spent half of my evening working through the FCC JS challenges. The other half was revisiting D3js documentation; I'm hoping to create a google map api or D3js based interactive map for a game I play....hmmm...thoughts are brewing.

### Day 5: February 01, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued FCC JS Course, studying arrays, and indexes.

**Thoughts:** Had a rough day at the office, set me back, and I just took an evening of mental relaxation for the last day of the month. Tonight though I think things head on, and started digging into understanding strings, multi-dimensional arrays, and indexes. I find that slowing down and working through the problem is helping. My biggest hurdle so far has just been maintaining the vocabulary.

### Day 6: February 02, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC NYC Meetup, Gulp, BrowserSync, Continued FCC JS Course.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time with the FCC meetup leader learning about and setting Gulp and Browsersync as a development environment. Wonderful tool for automating your process/workflow and then spent some more time on the FCC JS course/challenges.

It was quite humbling working with the leader tonight. It's moments like these where you realize how little you know in comparison to where you think you are. I still think my biggest hurdle so far has just been maintaining the vocabulary, but I love the fact that everything is an intricate puzzle. 

I think I'll add a "goals" section to preface progress. It might help me maintain a more realistic understanding of where I'm at and where I'm going.

### Day 7-8: February 03-04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Git, Continued FCC JS Course, Switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Friday was spent tirelessly working through FCC Javascript courses, Saturday morning was watching and getting to understand Git through terminal. Saturday afternoon consisted of switch statements.
